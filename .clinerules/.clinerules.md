## Always review and ensure the following:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
6. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
7. Low Coupling
8. High Cohesion
9. Separation of Concerns (SoC) & Modularity

## Rules to follow

- When approaching a defect or bug fix ALWAYS write a test first to validate the bug. That way, upon implementing the solution the test can be run to ensure the bug was eliminated.
- We should NEVER keep legacy or duplicate code. A refactor or update means refactoring to a clean state and not leaving behind bloat and obselete code.
