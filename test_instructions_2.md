I have added enhanced diagnostic logging to the application to determine why the selection is still failing. My previous fix was clearly incorrect, and I need to gather more data to understand the true root cause.

Please run the application again and provide the debug output, just as you did before.

1.  Run the LunaDraw application in **Debug** mode.
2.  Once the app window appears, go back to your IDE (Visual Studio).
3.  From the menu bar, select **View** -> **Output**.
4.  In the Output window, make sure **Show output from:** is set to **Debug**.
5.  Copy the entire text from that Output window and paste it here.

The output will be much more detailed this time and will give me the necessary information to finally solve this problem. I apologize for making you repeat this process.
